# Robust Image Watermarking with Deep Autoencoders  

This repository contains the results of a **deep steganography-based image watermarking technique** using **autoencoders** and **CNNs**. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of **imperceptibility, robustness, and security**, as measured by **PSNR, SSIM, and NC**.

## 🔬 Research Overview  
- Developed a **novel deep learning-based approach** for embedding and extracting watermarks from images.
- Integrated the classic image transformation with modern deep autoencoder using CNN for better performance.
- Designed and trained a **deep autoencoder network** to efficiently encode and retrieve hidden information.  
- **Validated** the technique across two key use cases:
  - **Hiding signatures in X-ray images** 🏥  
  - **Embedding logos in documents** 📜  

## 🛠️ Features  
- ✅ **High imperceptibility**: Watermark embedding with minimal distortion.  
- ✅ **Robustness**: Optimized against **standard image watermarking attacks**.  
- ✅ **Deep Learning-based**: Uses **autoencoders** and **CNNs** for encoding and retrieval.
